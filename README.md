This was a project for my 2nd year, 2nd semester subject "Programming techniques".

The given task was to design an application that simulates shop queues using threads, randomly generates clients, distributes them to queues and shows the progress of the queues in real-time.

The complete task description can be seen in the _HW2_Task.pdf_ file, while the exact grading criteria are in the _HW2_Grading.pdf_ file.

A more detailed description of the project, the employed classes, design patterns used, use-cases covered, assumptions made and so on can be found in the _Assignment 2 Documentation.pdf_ file.
